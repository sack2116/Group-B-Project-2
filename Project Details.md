# Project Proposal: Creditworthiness Classification
## Objective
The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in customer creditworthiness to help predict their likelihood of repaying loans. We’ll examine relationships between factors such as income levels, payment behavior, credit mix, and debt ratios. Our goal is to use these variables to classify customers into categories based on their credit scores—Good, Standard, or Poor—using a machine learning model. This project has the potential to support financial institutions in making data-driven decisions on loan approvals, minimizing risk, and promoting financial accessibility.

# Data and Field of Study
Field: Finance
Data Type: Customer credit profile data, including attributes like income level, payment history, credit mix, and outstanding debt.

# Research Questions
Primary Question: Based on a customer's financial profile, can we accurately predict their credit score category (Good, Standard, Poor)?
Comparative Analysis: How do different factors—such as income or payment history—correlate with a customer’s likelihood of defaulting?
Feature Importance: Which factors contribute most significantly to creditworthiness, and how can they inform lending policies?
# Data Source
The dataset will be sourced from financial data from publicly available credit datasets ( Kaggle) containing at least 1,000 customer records. This data will allow us to implement supervised classification models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression.
